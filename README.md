  - In the console that appears at the bottom, type the command `Update-Database` and wait for the migration to finish.
- Run the project
  - Press `Control + F5` to run the project without the debugger, or `F5` to run the project with the debugger attached.
- Seed Data
  - When running the project for the first time, the database will be seeded with an admin user.
  - You can log in to this account with the username `admin` and the password `Password123!`. It is _highly_ recommended that you change this password after logging in for the first time.
